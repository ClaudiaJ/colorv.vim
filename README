 INTRO:
    ColorV or ColorV.vim is a Color Viewer and Color Picker of Vim.

    It looks like most morden GUI color pickers.
    You can quickly view/edit the color under cursor or in clipboard.

    Also, you can simply use mouse/keyboard to choose your desired color.
    
    And there are several commands and keymappings to interact with it.

    Moreover, if you have '+python' and pygtk2.0. You can use a gtk color
picker with it.

    It also provide some functions like |ColorV#rgb2hsv()| for directly using.

    That's it.
